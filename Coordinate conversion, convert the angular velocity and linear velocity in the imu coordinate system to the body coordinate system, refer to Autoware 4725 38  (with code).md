Requirements: Obtain speed information (angular velocity + linear velocity) in geometry_msgs :: TwistStamped format Method 1: Obtain the linear velocity from the chassis, imu obtain the yaw angular velocity data, and then combine the data to publish information. Method 2: By fusing the pose (x, y, yaw) of the positioning output, calculate the linear velocity and yaw angular velocity through the front and rear frames, and then publish the information. Method 1 implements: Header file:
